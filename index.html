      SEE ALL SLIDES BEGIN SLIDESHOW A model wearing a purple look with white

      before the new year, you might be tempted to overlook 2022's biggest
      fashion trends in favor of a 24/7 sweatpants existence until 2023. Lucky
      for you, soft clothes are a piece of the style puzzle. That said, they’re
      not the only items on deck. Nostalgia is the name of the game. With Y2K
      fashion peaking higher than ever, the remainder of the year has plenty of
      fun trends in store. Spotlight-stealing attire with a joyous mood is
      taking over ahead of the holidays, from vivid colors and prints to bold
      silhouettes like bubble dresses, volume tops, cut-outs galore, and
      ultra-low rises on pants and skirts. Accessories are in on the fun, too.
      Think: chunky-AF platforms, rainbow-bright bags, and a more-is-more
      jewelry aesthetic combining beads, pearls, and rhinestone-decked baubles.
      Oh, and if your 2022 resolution was to adopt a new signature color, you
      better make it purple — it’s the 2022 hue in all tints, from Pantone’s
      Very Peri color of the year to saturated violet and lavender shades.
      Ahead, a deeper dive into 2022's biggest fashion trends to fit before the
      year ends. Naturally, with an edit to shop. At Refinery29, we’re here to
      help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market
      picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. If you
